# Youtube-Analytics-MIS-584
A data analytics project focused on gathering and analyzing YouTube data for insights. This repository demonstrates how to retrieve data from YouTube (e.g., via YouTube Data API), clean and transform it, and then visualize or analyze the data to generate meaningful conclusions.

This project was created for the MIS 584 course (or a similar course/project context) to demonstrate how to work with the YouTube platformâ€™s data to uncover patterns such as:

Channel growth analysis
Video performance metrics (views, likes, comments, watch time)
Audience demographics and engagement metrics
Performance comparisons over time
